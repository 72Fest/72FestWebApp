There's still a slot left- don't be left behind crying about how you wished you did it this year. Cause we know you'd be crying. And your significant other will be rolling their eyes fighting the urge to say "I told you you should have done it. But no, you never listen to me. Instead you're gonna subject me to this week long of whining and then another year of 'I think I'm gonna do it this year, Yeah I think I'm actually gonna do it. Wait nope.' You know what? I'm sick of it. I want to breakup." 
You can easily avoid this terrible scenario. Register now while you can.

Teams - if you're looking for cast/crew post below. There are still a couple slots left, so register now if you’re on the fence!

    <b>Two Weeks Left</b><br/>
    Only Two Weeks until launch! That's crazy right?! In exactly two weeks we'll have 40+ teams who will be out and about discussing their criteria, drinking lots of soda, probably wishing they had some other team's criteria. A few short hours after that the in fighting begins where someone on the team feels like someone else isn't pulling their weight. After a few whispers about said weight-non-puller the passive aggressive behavior begins. A few hours after that the first person to fall asleep gets a prank pulled on them and they'll harbor resentment the entire weekend. Then the constant alternating sleepy hangry fights begin. Actors start making weird demands. All the food starts to dwindle and eventually all you got left is a large bag of stale Twizzlers from last year. It rains on your only exterior shot. And your significant other picks a fight cause he/she feels left out. But it's all ok because in the end everyone knows you can just blame everything that doesn't work on the writer, editor or the sound person. Doesn't that sound like an amazing weekend? What are you waiting for?! Sign up now!
