    <b>JOIN A TEAM - OR FIND TALENT/CREW</b><br/>
We currently have two young actors that recently were Ping Pong Summer (written and directed by Michael Tully and staring John Hannah, Lea Thompson, Judah Friedlander, and Susan Sarandon) who are looking to be on a Team for this years Fest.  This is a great opportunity for a team to pick up some talent to enhance their film and give them an edge over another team.  If you are interested let us know and we'll help put you in touch with these actors.  If you are looking for a team to join, check out <a href="http://www.72fest.com/need-a-team-or-need-talent/" target="_blank">http://www.72fest.com/need-a-team-or-need-talent/</a>  for more information.  We'll be keeping this page up to date with all requests that come in.  Teams be sure to check that page often to see if there is anyone that you could use to help enhance your team.  We'll be having an area at the Frederick Launch Party to meet any talent that hasn't been claimed by a team yet.</div>

        <p class="feedContent"><b>TEAM VIDEOS - HAVE YOU TURNED YOURS IN?</b><br/>
ALL TEAMS must submit a team video prior to LAUNCH.  A lot of you haven't turned one in yet. If we don't have one by the night of the Launch- you'll look pretty silly the night of the Fest.</p>
