    <b>Two Weeks Left</b><br/>
    You can do this one: Only Two Weeks until launch! That's crazy right?! In exactly two weeks we'll have 40+ teams who will be out and about discussing their criteria, drinking lots of soda, probably wishing they had some other team's criteria. A few short hours after that the in fighting begins where someone on the team feels like someone else isn't pulling their weight. After a few whispers about said weight-non-puller the passive aggressive behavior begins. A few hours after that the first person to fall asleep gets a prank pulled on them and they'll harbor resentment the entire weekend. Then the constant alternating sleepy hangry fights begin. Actors start making weird demands. All the food starts to dwindle and eventually all you got left is a large bag of stale Twizzlers from last year. It rains on your only exterior shot. And your significant other picks a fight cause he/she feels left out. But it's all ok because in the end everyone knows you can just blame everything that doesn't work on the writer, editor or the sound person. Doesn't that sound like an amazing weekend?
